## 🧪 Alpha Debug Notes

GearBench is currently in **alpha release**, and includes a visible console window during execution. This is intentional and allows for easier debugging and community feedback.

### Reporting Issues

If you notice anything unusual (error messages, crashes, weird scores), please help by:

1. Copying the full **console output**  
2. Saving it into a `.txt` file  
3. Submitting it as an attachment in a GitHub issue or comment under the project

This helps us rapidly improve the stability and accuracy of the benchmark.

ℹ️ Note: The console prints the MD5 hash of the `GearBenchEngine.dll` file to verify integrity.  
This is safe and used for anti-cheat purposes only.
